# Data Science Projects

## Introduction

## Task 1: TITANIC SURVIVAL PREDICTION

In my first task, I analyzed the Titanic dataset to predict passenger survival, employing machine learning algorithms and data analysis techniques. Details of my approach and code implementation can be found on my GitHub repository [GitHub](https://github.com/rajeevbharadwaj9900)).

## Task 2: SALES PREDICTION USING PYTHON

In Task 2, I crafted a predictive model for sales using Python and machine learning techniques. You can explore the code and details on [GitHub](https://github.com/rajeevbharadwaj9900)).

## Task 3: IRIS FLOWER CLASSIFICATION

The final task revolved around Iris Flower Classification, I used machine learning algorithms and data analytics to visualize. Details of my approach and code implementation can be found on my GitHub repository [GitHub](https://github.com/rajeevbharadwaj9900)).

## Conclusion

My time at the Codsoft Data Science Internship was great. I learned a lot of useful things that will help me with real-life data stuff. I'm thankful for the chance to work on important projects and I'm excited to use what I've learned in the future.
